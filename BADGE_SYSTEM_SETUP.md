# 🏆 Badge System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and test the new badge system for FourFourTwo.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Run Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Sync Badges from Config
```bash
php artisan badges:sync
```

### 3. Seed Badge Data (Optional)
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=BadgeSeeder
```

### 4. Check Achievements for Existing Users
```bash
php artisan achievements:check-all
```

## 🎯 System Overview

### **Automatic Badge Awarding**
The system automatically awards badges when users:
- Create predictions
- Make comments  
- Update their profile
- Get followers
- Achieve certain milestones

### **Badge Categories**
- **Bronze**: Welcome achievements (first prediction, comment, etc.)
- **Silver**: Progress achievements (accuracy, streaks, participation)
- **Gold**: Excellence achievements (high accuracy, rankings, influence)
- **Diamond**: Legendary achievements (perfect weeks, championships)

### **Key Features**
- ✅ Fully automated - no manual intervention needed
- ✅ Config-based badge definitions for easy management
- ✅ Real-time awarding via Laravel events
- ✅ Beautiful profile display with tier organization
- ✅ Rarity indicators for special badges
- ✅ Persian/RTL support

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test New User Flow
```bash
# 1. Create a test user (via registration or tinker)
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = \App\Models\User::factory()->create(['username' => 'testuser'])

# 2. Check their initial badges (should be empty)
>>> $user->badges()->count()

# 3. Make their first prediction (this should award 'first_prediction' badge)
>>> $fixture = \App\Models\Fixture::first()
>>> $prediction = $user->predictions()->create([
...     'fixture_id' => $fixture->id,
...     'home_score_predicted' => 2,
...     'away_score_predicted' => 1
... ])

# 4. Check if badge was awarded
>>> $user->fresh()->badges()->count()
>>> $user->badges()->first()->name
```

### Test Profile Completion
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = \App\Models\User::where('username', 'testuser')->first()
>>> $user->update(['bio' => 'Test bio', 'avatar' => 'test.jpg'])
>>> \App\Services\AchievementService::checkUserAchievements($user, 'profile_updated')
>>> $user->fresh()->hasBadge('profile_complete')
```

### Test Comment Badge
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = \App\Models\User::where('username', 'testuser')->first()
>>> $fixture = \App\Models\Fixture::first()
>>> $comment = $user->comments()->create([
...     'fixture_id' => $fixture->id,
...     'content' => 'Test comment'
... ])
>>> $user->fresh()->hasBadge('first_comment')
```

### Test Bulk Achievement Check
```bash
# Check achievements for all users
php artisan achievements:check-all

# Check for specific user
php artisan achievements:check-all --user-id=1
```

## 🎨 Frontend Testing

### View User Profile
1. Visit any user profile: `/@username`
2. Click on the "نشان‌ها" (Badges) tab
3. Verify badges are displayed by tier
4. Check that recent badges show up
5. Verify empty state for users without badges

### Badge Display Features
- ✅ Tier-based organization (Diamond → Gold → Silver → Bronze)
- ✅ Rarity indicators for rare badges (<10% of users)
- ✅ Recent badges section
- ✅ Badge count in tab title
- ✅ Hover tooltips with descriptions
- ✅ Beautiful tier colors and icons
- ✅ Persian date formatting
- ✅ RTL support

## 🔧 Management Commands

### Sync Badge Definitions
```bash
# Sync all badge definitions from config to database
php artisan badges:sync
```

### Check All Achievements
```bash
# Check and award achievements for all users
php artisan achievements:check-all

# Check for specific user
php artisan achievements:check-all --user-id=123
```

### Manual Badge Management (via Tinker)
```bash
php artisan tinker

# Award a badge manually
>>> $user = \App\Models\User::find(1)
>>> $user->awardBadge('first_prediction')

# Check if user has a badge
>>> $user->hasBadge('first_prediction')

# Get user's badges by tier
>>> $user->getBadgesByTier()

# Get user's recent badges
>>> $user->getRecentBadges()
```

## 📊 Badge Statistics

### View Badge Statistics (via Tinker)
```bash
php artisan tinker

# Get badge with user count
>>> $badge = \App\Models\Badge::where('key', 'first_prediction')->first()
>>> $badge->users_count
>>> $badge->rarity

# Get all badges with statistics
>>> \App\Models\Badge::active()->get()->map(function($b) {
...     return [
...         'name' => $b->name,
...         'users' => $b->users_count,
...         'rarity' => $b->rarity . '%'
...     ];
... })
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Badges Not Awarding
1. Check if badge system is enabled: `config('badges.enabled')`
2. Verify badge definitions exist: `php artisan badges:sync`
3. Check event listeners are registered in `AchievementServiceProvider`
4. Verify user meets badge criteria: manually check stats

#### Frontend Not Showing Badges
1. Ensure `BadgeDisplay` component is imported correctly
2. Check that controller passes badge data to view
3. Verify badge data structure in browser dev tools
4. Check for JavaScript console errors

#### Performance Issues
1. Enable Redis caching for badge statistics
2. Consider queuing achievement checks for high-traffic events
3. Monitor database query performance

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if service provider is registered
php artisan config:cache
php artisan config:clear

# View all registered events
php artisan event:list

# Check badge configuration
php artisan tinker
>>> config('badges.definitions')
```
